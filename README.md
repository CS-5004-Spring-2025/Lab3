## Program Operation

The goal of this program is to build the class structure to support an online market place. The `main` method will test the code you develop by creating several instances and invoking methods as specified. 


## Program Design

The starter code includes Javadoc describing the classes and methods you must implement. You are
responsible for implementing the following methods as described in the starter
code documentation:

### `Product`
`Product` is an *abstract* class that has been provided for you.

### `Constants`
`Constants` is a helper class that has been provided for you.

### `ConsoleView`
`ConsoleView` is a helper class that has been provided for you.

### `Clothing`
- Define required data members.
- `Constructor`
- `getSize`
- `calculateFinalPrice`
- `getProductDetails`

### `Electronics`
- Define required data members.
- `Constructor`
- `getWarranty`
- `calculateFinalPrice`
- `getProductDetails`

### `MarketPlace`
- Implement manual testing code in the `main` method as described.

### Tests

You must implement at least three unit tests for `Clothing` and three for `Electronics`.

In addition to implementing the methods exactly as described, you are also expected to use the provided methods and data members where appropriate.
